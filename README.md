**Rewritten Cogs Originally Made by others**
*These cogs were originally written by others for V2. As they were used frequently on TrustyBot I ported them over quickly for V3. A better version may be available.*

>Autorole - Automaticall apply roles when a user joins the server

>Stickyroles - Keep user roles when they leave the server and re-join. Useful for muted roles.

>Welcome - Welcomes users to the server

>Modlogs - A more in-depth modlog cog for more information about users joining/leaving and messages edited/deleted.

>Fun - The fun cog from Appu's Selfbot rewritten for redbot V3 including adding reactions and other "fun" commands.

>Cleverbot - Have your bot respond with cleverbot responses

>Insult - Insult a user!

**Special cogs**
*These cogs are not meant for mainstream use but may provide some useful functions for some people. Support may be limited.*

>Trustyavatar - The cog that controls TrustyBot's changing Avatar image. It may be manually customized to ones liking.

>Trustybot - A collection of commands for Messing around with. Some functions may find their way to a more versatile cog eventually.

>Backup - Backs up all messages on a server. Use with caution and ensure any backups are stored on an encrypted drive.

>gab - A cog to verify a user is on gab before letting them join the server.

>QPosts - Gathers new Q posts from 8ch.net and posts them in discord.

>Juche - Corrects dates posted in discord with the current Juche year.

>Dev - A copy of the developer commands in redbot with `sudo` replacing `mock` like V2. NOTE:This bypasses the `--dev` flag.

>Hue - A cog to control Philips Hue lights through discord. Not tested with bots outside the home network.

>Chatterbot - Teach your bot how to talk by watching conversations on servers and reply. Uses chatterbot library. NOTE: This cog is not recommended to be used at this time. After a month of usage it caused the whole bot to slow down while it searched for responses. I recommend looking at cleverbot for the time being.

>Blockchain - a cog to download and the bitcoin blockchain for hidden files and data. Requires bitcoin RPC connection and complicated setup **don't use** unless you know what you're doing.
